# Open-whole-Ai-

I want to live in a world where everyone has the same access to excellent psychological healthcare. No longer will the peace that comes from compassionate counsel or an understanding psychologist be the privilege of the middle and upper class prosperous. 

We are building a catalyst to the people of the world healing of Trauma and the effects on every part of their lives and relationships. This Github repository is a place to share our love for others by building something that will serve them in their current confusion.

I want to recruit you to your destiny.
You may be the most intelligent person who has read this GitHub readme file, but you are not smarter than all of us together. Let's honour each other and have fun as we create an Ai that will heal the world of emotional Trauma.

Trauma is transformable and broken heart can be bound up. The transformed go to inspire all of us to love ourselves again and forgive our abusers/betrayers.

Together we can build a conversational interface experience that helps us all understand our story in a compassionate way that lets us live with great love for ourselves, God and others.

I believe that an Ai conversational experiences can prompt people to understand themselves in the same way psychologists or counsellors questioning evoke an understanding of oneself that brings peace and purpose in the place of pain and powerlessness. 

Welcome to the team who want to see psychological aid scale to every human on the planet.
